<ul>
  <li>Developed a <b>Python</b> tool to compile <b>C</b> code into onboarded <b>RISCV</b> machine code for a <b>Verilog</b> ROM module compatible with
system-on-chip bus protocols.</li>
  <li>Fixed critical bugs in the system-on-chip, directly leading to the teamâ€™s first <b>100%</b> functional SOC and led to future research projects, including integrated machine learning projects, and more funding for the next version of the chip.</li>
  <li>Developed test vectors for verifying AFTx04  with NSWC Crane and
MIT-Lincoln Lab engineers.</li>
</ul>
