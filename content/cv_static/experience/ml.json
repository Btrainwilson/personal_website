    " Raised $27k in computing resources through grants, saved $40k in ML costs through server maintenance, and assisted in raising $200k+ for the <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/quantum-science-center-concludes-second-annual-summer-school-style\">QSC Summer Schools</a>. ",
    " Created quantum machine learning algorithms for designing meta-optical devices, achieving a 16200% quantum speed-up resulting in a major milestone for the <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/sci/article/2021/53/531104/365746/Framework-maps-continuous-space-inverse-design\">Quantum Science Center</a> with two news articles and 18 citations <a href=\"https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/News/2022/ece-researchers-develop-quantum-machine-learning-algorithm-for-optimizing-arbitrary-engineering-problems\">[1]</a>.",
    " Engineered and deployed GPU-accelerated computational physics packages to support multiple research projects with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nanometaml.github.io/mcmc\">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://btrainwilson.github.io/polytensor\">polynomial computation</a>, leading to a 6000% speed-up over CPU-based algorithms. ",
    "Led 6 researchers to develop transformer ML algorithms for tackling the $75B counterfeit chip market leading to a 5,500,000% speed-up and 41% accuracy increase in the verification of semiconductor devices. Submitted to CVPR 2024. Patent in progress. "
